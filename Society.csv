Anything written now would not qualify as an ancient artifact, at least not until modern times are considered ancient, at which point the book itself would indeed be an ancient artifact. 
  Archeologists have discovered tools that predate the entire homo genus. 
  This image, if you look closely, is of a very old book. It would probably be an artifact by now, but here it's used to point you to the answer to this question.",
SG8,SAG157,A Beginner's on Archeology,Society,General,L2,One of the most important archeological sites is Pompeii. What happened in 79 AD that caused so many artifacts to be preserved?,Tidal wave washed all the dirt away,Artists created mini-replicas,New king decreed city sacred,City was preserved under volcanic ash,D,,"When Mt. Vesuvius exploded in 79 AD, it instantly decimated the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, covering them with many layers of ash and pumice. Other cities were built over these layers, and it took hundreds and hundreds of years before archeologists uncovered the ancient ruins beneath. One of the most fascinating finds was spaces of air archeologists kept finding in the ash. Eventually, they filled the spaces with plaster, and the plaster casts revealed what had been there when the volcano exploded: humans, as they were when the volcano blew. Some where tucked under, as if hiding from the destruction, while others were simply left standing, immortalized forever. 
  This image portrays the makings of an at-home volcano.",

  This image is a close-up of orbicular granodiorite; the Rosetta Stone is also made of granodiorite.",
SG8,SAG159,A Beginner's on Archeology,Society,General,L2,"Discovered in Shanxi, a province in Central China, were ancient artifacts made out terra cotta. What was their shape?",Birds,"Nothing in particular, just rocks",Warriors,Musical instruments,C,,"The Terracotta Warriors are part of a huge archeological find discovered by farmers in the 1970s. It is truly extraordinary in size and scope. The site was built around 210 BCE as a royal tomb for Qin Shi Huang, who was the first Emperor of China. He was buried with over 8,000 individual warrior figures, as well as hundreds of chariots and horses, all of them life-sized. It was likely believed that the Emperor would be protected in the afterlife by the terracotta army. Parts of the army are exhibited at the British Museum in London, and some of them have been part of a traveling exhibit. 
  This image is of an army, not of warriors but of ants.",
SG8,SAG160,A Beginner's on Archeology,Society,General,L2,"The Cave of Altamira, found by an amateur archeologist and his young daughter in 1879, revealed cave paintings of animals, handprints, and abstract shapes from the stone age. In what country would you find this awesome cave?",England,Spain,Egypt,Russia,B,,"The Cave of Altamira is located in Spain, not far from Basque territory. Altamira translate roughly to ""High Look"" and is over 1000 meters long. Archeologically it is quite interesting for many reasons, one of which is that after its Stone Age inhabitants moved on, it was sealed off, likely by a rock slide, from human contact for thousands of years, thereby essentially preserving the ancient paintings. 
  The cave is so popular with visitors that authorities had to close it to the public; carbon dioxide from people breathing in the cave was beginning to damage the cave paintings. In response, several replicas have been built for people to visit and study. 
  This is a rough sketch of a Basque-style hat.",
